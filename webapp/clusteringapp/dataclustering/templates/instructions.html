	    	While there are many different types of clustering algorithms, our application focuses solely on hierarchical agglomerative clustering. We make it simple to cluster a set of data. The most important step in using our application is the format of the CSV file that is uploaded. Any names or lables of data need to go in the first column by themselves. The rest of the columns to the right of the name/label column are for numerical values. You can list as many as you want but be sure that each row in the CSV file contains the same number of columns filled out. If something doesn't have a certain value for that specific column, just add a 0.0 in the box. The file also cannot contain any labels for the data at the top. It is best to create a copy of your data that is strictly for uploading to our application.

	    <h3>Options</h3>
	    <p>
	    	We offer several clustering options to choose from. We will compute the time it takes to complete the clustering for your data, and if it is too long to wait, we provide a space for you to supply us with your email so that we may contact you when your clustering is finished. You will then receive a code that you can enter to see your clustering results. The distance metrics that we allow you to choose from are Euclidean distance and Pearson Correlation. They each have their advantages, and it is interesting to compare the differences in their results. The next option that we allow users to select from is the linkage type. The linkage type deals with how a cluster is compared to the other clusters. Single linkage will select the smallest distance value from each cluster being merged together to be the new distance to every other cluster. Complete linkage will select the larget distance, and average linkage, will average all of the distances instead of choosing the larger or the smaller of the two.

     <h3> Inserting A Code </h3>
    <p>
    	If your clustering takes too long, we will email you a code that is linked with the completed dendrogram for your clustering. Simple navigate to 
    	<a href="www.klustering.me/insertcode">Insert Code</a> and insert your code into the prompt.
